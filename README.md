# RTA-Severity-Prediction
This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments for Masters research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms.

## Notebook Building
The notebook is builded using Jupyter notebook the in following steps
* Importing Libraies
* Importing Dataset
* Exploratary Data Analysis (EDA)
* Preprocessing
* Model Building
* Fine Tuning
* Explanaible AI (XAI)
* Select Feature for API
* Again Train Model on Selected Feature
* Deploy on Web
### Importing Libraies
At the beginning of the notebook, I initiate by importing fundamental libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Throughout the notebook creation process, I incorporate any necessary additional libraries. Eventually, I compile a comprehensive list of all the imported libraries, which is positioned at the beginning of the notebook.
### Importing Dataset
